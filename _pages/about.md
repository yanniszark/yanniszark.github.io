CS PhD student at Columbia University working on eBPF applications with
professor [Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). Check out our
[XRP project](https://github.com/xrp-project/XRP/blob/main/XRP%20Draft.pdf)
which accelerates storage accesses using eBPF.

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Arrikto](https://arrikto.com/) working
on cloud-native machine learning infrastructure
([Kubeflow](http://kubeflow.org/)). I also created the
[Rook Cassandra Operator](https://github.com/rook/cassandra) and the
[Scylla Operator](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/), which was
adopted and continued by the company as their official solution to deploy on
Kubernetes.
