I'm a CS PhD student at Columbia University working with [Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/).
I am interested in systems, especially performance optimizations.

Current projects:
- [With Google] New low-level TPU profiler for Large Language Models.
- Using eBPF for configurable page cache eviction in the Linux kernel.
- Async replication of a sharded database with prefix consistency guarantees.


Previously, I was a software engineer at [Arrikto](https://arrikto.com/) working
on cloud-native machine learning infrastructure
([Kubeflow](http://kubeflow.org/)). I also created the
[Rook Cassandra Operator](https://github.com/rook/cassandra) and the
[Scylla Operator](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator/), which was
adopted and continued by the company as their official solution to deploy on
Kubernetes.
